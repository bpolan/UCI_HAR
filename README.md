## Description
UCI_HAR_data_stuff.R does the following:

### 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
